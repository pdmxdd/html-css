    <p>HTML defines the structure of our webpage, and defines the static content of our webpage. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>titles</li>
        <li>paragraphs</li>
        <li>images</li>
        <li>lists</li>
        <li>links</li>
        <li>and more</li>
    </ul>
    <a href="https://launchcode.org">Click here for LaunchCode</a>
    <p>HTML is also our container. It must include any CSS, or JavaScript we want to include with this project. You can write inline JavaScript with a script tag, or anline CSS by defining the style of an HTML tag.</p>
    <p class="blue-paragraph">However a better solution to keep your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in separate, easy to maintain files is to use external CSS, and JavaScript. You would need to create the files separately and link to them in the head tag of your HTML file.</p>
